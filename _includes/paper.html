                            We introduce a novel architecture for neural disparity refinement aimed at facilitating deployment of 3D computer vision  on cheap and widespread consumer devices, such as mobile phones. Our approach relies on a continuous formulation that enables to estimate a refined disparity map at any arbitrary output resolution. Thereby, it  can handle effectively the unbalanced camera setup typical of nowadays mobile phones, which feature both  high and low resolution RGB sensors within the same device. Moreover, our neural network can  process seamlessly the output of a variety of stereo methods and, by refining the disparity maps computed by a traditional matching algorithm like SGM, it can  achieve unpaired zero-shot generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end stereo models.
