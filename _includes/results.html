            Results on the SceneFlow testing set. From left to right, the RGB input image, the noisy input disparity map computed by SGM (rows 1-2),
            AD-Census (rows 3-4), C-CNN (rows 5-6) and the corresponding refined disparity estimated by our network.

            Generalization results on Middlebury 2014 of our network (pre-trained on SceneFlow).

            Generalization results on KITTI 2015 of our network (pre-trained on SceneFlow). 
            From left to right, the RGB input image, the noisy input disparity map computed by SGM and the refined disparity estimated by our network.

            Our network is able to handle also inputs with different resolutions. The top row depicts the input image, at 3840 × 2160
            and the disparity maps, D, computed by SGM when the right image, is 480 × 270 and 320 × 180 (k = 8 and 12). The bottom
            row shows ground-truth and estimated disparity at 3840×2160.

          <p>
            Thanks to our continuous formulation we can estimate a disparity map at an arbitrary resolution. 
            In the figure we see the comparison against a standard Nearest Neighbor interpolation.
